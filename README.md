AI Sampler for my Capstone Class

In order to start, you are going to have to run Capstone.py for the training to begin, and then to test your model, you are going to need to download a test dataset. I downloaded the [MUSDB18-HQ dataset](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html). You only need to download the training data, as the training data has been preprocessed in .npy files. 

After that, all you need to do is run _python Separation.py_, and see how your model did.
